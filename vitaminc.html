        <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
        <p>Vitamin C plays a role in controlling infections and healing wounds, and is a powerful antioxidant that can neutralise harmful free radicals.</p>
        <p>Loading up on this vitamin was a practice spurred by Linus Pauling in the 1970s, a double Nobel laureate and self-proclaimed champion of vitamin C who promoted daily megadoses (the amount in 12 to 24 oranges) as a way to prevent colds and some chronic diseases.</p>
        <p>Even before its discovery in 1932, nutrition experts recognized that something in citrus fruits could prevent scurvy, a disease that killed as many as two million sailors between 1500 and 1800. </p>

        <h2>Natural Sources of Vitamin C</h2>
            <p>Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin. This means that it dissolves in water and is delivered to the bodyâ€™s tissues but is not well stored, so it must be taken daily through food or supplements.</p>
            <p>Below is a list of foods that are good natural sources for Vitamin C, along with the amount of Vitamin C per 100 grams. The recommended daily amount for vitamin C is 75 milligrams (mg) a day for women and 90 mg a day for men, although these are minimum amounts and usually megadoses are needed to be effective.</p>
