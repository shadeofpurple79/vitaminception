# VITAMINCEPTION

## Summary

Vitaminception is a guide for the big and complex worls of vitamins and supplements. A quick Google or Amazon search vitamins results in millions and billions of search results. There are hundreds of vitamin brands in the market and the product ingredients label is a mystery. If that wasn't enough, the advice from medical professionals, health coaches, nutritionists and of course the media are confusing and conflicting. Vitaminception takes this back to the beginning and explains the benefits of vitamins, the natural sources to obtain them and if necessary, the recommended supplements to take, in simple, plain terms.

According to datareportal.com, 92& of global internet users aged 16 to 64 go online via a mobile phone. For this reason, Vitaminception has been designed and developed with a mobile-first approach. Alternative views for tablets and desktops have also been provided for such users.

## Features

Vitaminception explains each vitamin individually in very simple terms. Each vitamin type has its own unique page, with a short description on what the vitamin is for, how it's used by the body, what the benefits are, and the consequences of being deficient in this vitamin. Each vitamin page then goes on to cite external sources, cherry picked for the audience of this website; a short video, a scientific or medical research article, and a book. 

The final section of each vitamin page is a small shop area where a selection of only three vitamin products selected by the Vitaminception authors. The user will be able to click on these links to directly visit a shopping website and complete their purchase. 

Vitaminception business will have special commercial agreements with the selected three suppliers where the business will earn a commission on each purchase made in this way.
